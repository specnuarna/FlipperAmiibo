## Troubleshooting tips
 
If you encounter any problems during or after the firmware update, here are some tips to help you solve them:

- If your tablet does not boot up or gets stuck on the Wolder logo, try to perform a factory reset. This will erase all your data and settings, so make sure you have a backup before doing this. To perform a factory reset, follow the same steps as above to enter the recovery menu, but select "wipe data/factory reset" instead of "apply update from sdcard". Confirm with the power button and wait for the process to finish.
- If your tablet does not recognize the firmware file or shows an error message during the installation, make sure you have downloaded the correct file for your device. Check the serial number and the file name carefully. Also, make sure the file is not corrupted or incomplete. You can verify this by checking the file size and comparing it with the one on the website. If the file is corrupted or incomplete, download it again and try again.
- If your tablet has low battery or shuts down during the installation, plug it into a power source and try again. Do not interrupt the installation process or turn off your device while it is updating. This can cause serious damage to your device and make it unusable.

If none of these tips work or you have other issues with your device, contact Wolder customer service for further assistance. You can find their contact information on their website or in the user manual of your device.
